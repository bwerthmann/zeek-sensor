Run an Elastic Agent standalone to configure and update the agent manually on the host where the agent is installed.

1. Copy this policy to the elastic-agent.yml on the host where the Elastic Agent is installed. Modify ES_USERNAME and ES_PASSWORD in the outputs section of elastic-agent.yml to use your Elasticsearch credentials.

2. Select the appropriate platform and run commands to install, enroll, and start Elastic Agent. Reuse commands to set up agents on more than one host. For aarch64, see our downloads page(opens in a new tab or window). For additional guidance, see our installation docs(opens in a new tab or window).

```
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.6.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf elastic-agent-8.6.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-8.6.1-linux-x86_64
sudo ./elastic-agent install
```

... or ...

We recommend using the installers (TAR/ZIP) over system packages (RPM/DEB) because they provide the ability to upgrade your agent with Fleet.

```
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.6.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i elastic-agent-8.6.1-amd64.deb 
sudo systemctl enable elastic-agent 
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
```
